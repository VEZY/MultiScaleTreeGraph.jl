# Accessing node data

```@setup usepkg
using MultiScaleTreeGraph
file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(MultiScaleTreeGraph))),"test","files","simple_plant.mtg")
mtg = read_mtg(file)
```

## Read an MTG file

Let's first read a simple MTG file:

```@example usepkg
using MultiScaleTreeGraph

file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(MultiScaleTreeGraph))),"test","files","simple_plant.mtg")
mtg = read_mtg(file)
```

!!! node
    If you print a node, it will always print its subtree. So if we print the root node it will print the entire MTG.

[`read_mtg`](@ref) returns a [`Node`](@ref) object.

```@example usepkg
typeof(mtg)
```

This node is the root node of the MTG, meaning the first node of the MTG, the one without any parent.

!!! note
    Root node and leaf node mean a node without any parent or children respectively. These terms are used in the sense of a [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)).

## The Node type

### What's a node?

As we learned in the previous section, the node is used as the elementary object to build the MTG. In this package, a node is a data structure used to hold these informations (*i.e.* fields). See the [MTG implementation](@ref) section for more details.

### Accessing the fields of a node

The first node of the whole MTG is all we need to access every other nodes in the MTG, because they are all linked together.

You can list the fiels in a node like so:

```@example usepkg
fieldnames(typeof(mtg))
```

To get the values stored inside a field of a node, you can use the dot notation, *e.g.*:

```@example usepkg
mtg.attributes
```

The `MTG` field from the node helps us describe the node within the MTG. Let's see what's in it:

```@example usepkg
fieldnames(typeof(mtg.MTG))
```

We see that it holds the MTG fields: the scale, symbol, index and link to its parent.

### Get other nodes

We can move in the MTG from node to node because we know its parents and children.

To do so, we use either the dot notation, or the corresponding functions.

#### Get children nodes

To get the children of a node, you can use either the dot notation to get them in a Dict{id,node} format:

```@example usepkg
mtg.children
```

or as a vector of nodes using `children`:

```@example usepkg
children(mtg)
```

You can also index the node using an integer, and it will return the corresponding child:

```@example usepkg
mtg[1]
```

We can iteratively index into the nodes to access the descendants of a node. For example if we need to access the 6th node (the 2nd Internode), we would do:

```@example usepkg
node_6 = mtg[1][1][1][2]
```

#### Get the parent node

To get the parent you can use:

```@example usepkg
mtg.parent
```

Or:

```@example usepkg
parent(mtg)
```

Note that it returns `nothing` here because the root node has no parent.

#### Get the node siblings

To get the node siblings:

```@example usepkg
siblings(mtg[1][1][1][1])
```

!!! note
    We repeatedly index into the MTG (`mtg[1][1][1][1]`) to get the fourth generation descendant of the root node, because it is the only one with a sibling in our example MTG.

#### Get any node

To get any node in the MTG, you can get it by its id:

```@example usepkg
get_node(mtg, 3)
```

or by its name:

```@example usepkg
get_node(mtg, "node_5")
```

!!! note
    [`get_node`](@ref) returns the first node it finds with the name it is given. If the names of your nodes are not unique, you better consider searching them by id instead.

You can list all node ids using [`list_nodes`](@ref):

```@example usepkg
list_nodes(mtg)
```

#### Get the root node

To get the root node from any other node, simply use [`get_root`](@ref):

```@example usepkg
node_5 = get_node(mtg, 5)

get_root(node_5)
```

### Get the attributes

This section has its own tutorial! Head over the next page to learn how to get the nodes attributes.
