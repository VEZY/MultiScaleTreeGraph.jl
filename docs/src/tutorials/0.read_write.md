# Read and Write MTGs

```@setup usepkg
using MultiScaleTreeGraph
file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(MultiScaleTreeGraph))),"test","files","simple_plant.mtg")
mtg = read_mtg(file)
```

## Read

### Reading a file

Reading an MTG is done using the [`read_mtg`](@ref) function:

```@example usepkg
file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(MultiScaleTreeGraph))),"test","files","simple_plant.mtg")

mtg = read_mtg(file)
```

The file given in input can be either a `.mtg`, `.csv`, `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` file.

### Options

The function has one optional argument to set the type used for the MTG field (see next section for more details). It also has a keyword argument to choose the sheet name in case you're reading an `xlsx` or `xlsm` file.

#### Attributes type

Attributes are stored using the columnar backend (`ColumnarAttrs`) by default.

This backend keeps one typed table per symbol and is optimized for repeated traversal and attribute retrieval. In practice:

- users can still create nodes with `Dict`/`NamedTuple`-like attribute inputs;
- those inputs are converted to the columnar representation when nodes are attached to an MTG.

So for most workflows, there is no extra option to choose here: use the default.

#### MTG encoding type

The MTG encoding type can be either immutable or mutable. By default we use a mutable one ([`MutableNodeMTG`](@ref)), but you can use the immutable one by setting the `mtg_type` argument of the function to [`NodeMTG`](@ref). If you're planning on modifying the MTG encoding of some of your nodes, you should use [`MutableNodeMTG`](@ref), and if you don't want to modify anything, use [`NodeMTG`](@ref) instead as it should be faster.

!!! note
    Again, if you don't know what to use, use the default.

#### Sheet name

If you're reading your MTG from a `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` file, you can choose the sheet you want to read by using the keyword argument `sheet_name`.

If you don't provide anything for the sheet name, it will read the first one by default.

!!! note
    Keyword arguments must be explicitly named in the function call. In this case it would be:
    ```julia
    file = joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(MultiScaleTreeGraph))),"test","files","tree3h.xlsx")
    mtg = read_mtg(file, sheet_name = "A3H")
    ```

## Write

Writing an MTG back to disk is as simple as this:

```@example usepkg
temporary_file = tempname() # using a temporary file here, but you should put the path to the file you want to write

write_mtg(temporary_file, mtg)
```

## Build manually

It is also possible to build an MTG from scratch using `MultiScaleTreeGraph.jl`. It is explained in a further tutorial [Make an MTG manually](@ref).
