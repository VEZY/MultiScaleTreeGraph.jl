# Transform an MTG

### Assign attributes to a node

It is possible to change the values of attributes in a node. For example one could be interested to compute the total length of all nodes for the scene in our example MTG. In this case we can do:

```@example usepkg
mtg[:Length] = sum(descendants(mtg, :Length, ignore_nothing = true))
```

### Compute attributes in an MTG

Now MTGs can be very large, and it quickly becomes cumbersome to manually visit each node to change its value by hand.

Instead, you can compute new attributes for all nodes in an MTG using `transform`. For example to compute the total length each node in an MTG is holding, *i.e.* the length of its sub-tree, we would do:

```@example usepkg
transform!(mtg, :Length, ignore_nothing = true))
```
