# Add/remove nodes

```@setup usepkg
using MultiScaleTreeGraph
```

## Make an MTG manually

It is very easy to add or remove nodes in an MTG. Actually, we can even construct an MTG completely manually.

### Root node

Create the root node:

```@example usepkg
mtg = Node(MutableNodeMTG("/", "Plant", 0, 1), Dict{Symbol,Any}(:species => "Grassy-plant"))
```

The first argument to [`Node`](@ref) is the name. For the root node we usually use "node_1". The second argument is a [`MutableNodeMTG`](@ref) (or a [`NodeMTG`](@ref)) that defines the topology of the node: its link to its parent (the root node always decomposes), its symbol, its index and its scale. The third and last argument is used to add attributes to the MTG.

### Node id

The ids of the nodes should be unique. They are automatically computed using [`new_id`](@ref) starting by 1 at the root node:

```@example usepkg
new_id(mtg)
```

### Adding new nodes

To create a child node, we use a different method of [`Node`](@ref). This method is close to the one we used for the root, except there is a new argument at the second position: the parent node. Here we use the root node as the parent (`mtg`), and the unique id (`new_id`) as the child name.

```@example usepkg
IN1 = Node(mtg, MutableNodeMTG("/", "Internode", 0, 2), Dict{Symbol,Any}(:diameter => 0.1, :length => 0.5))
```

Now the MTG has two nodes:

```@example usepkg
mtg
```

We can continue like this indefinitely. For example we can add a leaf to the first internode:

```@example usepkg
Node(IN1, MutableNodeMTG("+", "Leaf", 0, 2), Dict{Symbol,Any}(:area => 0.2))
```

!!! note
    If a node has no children, there is no need to keep track of it in an object.

And an internode following the first internode:

```@example usepkg
IN2 = Node(IN1, MutableNodeMTG("<", "Internode", 1, 2), Dict{Symbol,Any}(:diameter => 0.15, :length => 0.3))
```

And a leaf to it:

```@example usepkg
Node(IN2, MutableNodeMTG("+", "Leaf", 1, 2), Dict{Symbol,Any}(:area => 0.2))
```

And here is our resulting MTG:

```@example usepkg
mtg
```

And the attributes:

```@example usepkg
DataFrame(mtg, get_attributes(mtg))
```

### Inserting nodes

#### Insertion functions

Adding nodes recursively is easy, but sometimes we want to insert nodes in-between other nodes. We can still use `Node` to do so, but it becomes a bit cumbersome because you'll have to handle manually the changes in parents, children and siblings.

We provide some helper functions that does it for you instead:

- [`insert_parent!`](@ref): add a new parent node
- [`insert_child!`](@ref): add a new child node
- [`insert_sibling!`](@ref): add a new sibling node
- [`insert_generation!`](@ref): add a new child node, but this new child is considered a whole new generation, meaning the previous children of the node become the children of the new node.

!!! warning
    Note the singular form for the name of the functions. The plural form does the job on the whole MTG for selected nodes (see [Insert nodes at position](@ref)).

#### The NodeMTG

Those functions use a `NodeMTG` (or `MutableNodeMTG`), and automatically:

- find a unique id for the node
- add its children, parents and siblings
- update the links of the parents / siblings / children

```@example usepkg
mtg_2 = deepcopy(mtg)

insert_parent!(mtg_2, NodeMTG("/", "Scene", 0, 0))

mtg_2 = get_root(mtg_2)
```

The `NodeMTG` can also be computed based on the node on which we insert the new node. In this case we can pass a function that take the node as input and returns the template for us:

```@example usepkg
mtg_2 = deepcopy(mtg)

insert_parent!(
    mtg_2,
    node -> (
        link = node.MTG.link,
        symbol = "Scene",
        index = node.MTG.index,
        scale = node.MTG.scale - 1
    )
)
mtg_2 = get_root(mtg_2)

mtg_2.MTG
```

The MTG encoding field of the newly-created root node (`mtg_2.MTG`) used some of the information from the MTG to compute its values.

!!! note
    We use [`get_root!`](@ref) to recompute `mtg_2` because [`insert_parent!`](@ref) always return the input node, which is not the root node of the MTG anymore.

#### Node attributes

We can also provide attributes for the new node using the `attr_fun` argument. `attr_fun` expects a function that computes new attributes based on the input node. This function must return
attribute values of the same type as the one used for other nodes attributes in the MTG (*e.g.* `Dict` or `NamedTuple`).

To know what is the type used for the attributes of your MTG, you can use `typeof` as follows:

```@example usepkg
typeof(mtg.attributes)
```

If you just need to pass attributes values to a node, you can do as follows:

```@example usepkg
mtg_2 = deepcopy(mtg)

insert_child!(
    mtg_2,
    NodeMTG("/", "Axis", 0, 2),
    node -> Dict{Symbol, Any}(:length => 2, :area =>  0.1)
)

mtg_2[1].attributes
```

But we can also compute our attributes based on other nodes data:

```@example usepkg
mtg_2 = deepcopy(mtg)

insert_child!(
    mtg_2,
    NodeMTG("/", "Axis", 0, 2),
    node -> Dict{Symbol, Any}(:total_length => sum(descendants(node, :length, ignore_nothing = true)))
)

mtg_2[1].attributes
```

We use `mtg_2[1]` here to get the first child of the root node.

### Delete a node

It is possible to remove a single node in an MTG using [`delete_node!`](@ref). For example if we want to delete the second internode ("node_4"):

```@example usepkg
mtg_del = deepcopy(mtg)

delete_node!(get_node(mtg_del, "node_4"))

mtg_del
```

As we can see the new MTG has only one internode now, and the children of the second internode are now the children of its parents, the first internode.

But what if we deleted the first internode?

```@example usepkg
mtg_del = deepcopy(mtg)

delete_node!(get_node(mtg_del, "node_2"))

mtg_del
```

We see there is a warning now. This is because we don't really know what should be the new link for a branching child replacing a decomposing node. So by default we don't make any assumption and keep the scale of the child as it is, in the hope the user will look into it.

In our example the first leaf is now branching from the plant, while it should decompose it because it is not of the same scale. But a leaf decomposing a Plant has no meaning botanically. The best approach would be to keep an intermediary node, as it was before.

The user can define its own rules for the new links using the `child_link_fun` keyword argument of [`delete_node!`](@ref). It expect a function that takes the child node as input and return its new link.

For example one could decide to never replace the children link and manage them afterward. In this case we can use the identity function like this:

```@example usepkg
mtg_del = deepcopy(mtg)

delete_node!(get_node(mtg_del, "node_2"), child_link_fun = node -> node.MTG.link)

mtg_del
```

It didn't change anything here because the child already kept its own link. But it will differ for other types of parent / children links.

## Insert/remove nodes programmatically

Sometimes we want to remove or add a lot of nodes in an MTG. This is possible to do it programmatically using dedicated functions.

## Delete nodes

We can remove all nodes that meet specific conditions given by the usual node filters (see [Filters](@ref) for more details). For example one could remove all nodes of scale 2 in an MTG, *i.e.* all nodes except the Plant in our example:

```@example usepkg
mtg_2 = deepcopy(mtg)

delete_nodes!(mtg_2, scale = 2)
```

We can also remove nodes with more complex filters, for example all nodes with an index greater or equal to 1:

```@example usepkg
mtg_3 = deepcopy(mtg)

delete_nodes!(mtg_3, filter_fun = node -> node.MTG.index >= 1)
```

!!! note
    [`delete_nodes!`](@ref) always return the root node of the MTG. If the root node of the original MTG is deleted, its child becomes the new root node. If the root had several children, it returns an error. The function always return the root node of the new MTG, so if the root has not been modified, it remains the same, but if it has been deleted, the new root is returned. That is why it is preferable to use [`delete_nodes!`](@ref) has a non-mutating function and re-assign the results to an object if it is planned to remove the root node.

As for [`delete_node!`](@ref) (singular), by default [`delete_nodes!`](@ref) (plural) uses [`new_child_link`](@ref) to re-link the children of the deleted nodes, but the user can provide a custom function. See the function details to learn more about it.

## Insert nodes

### Insert nodes at position

We can add new nodes in an MTG programmatically using:

- [`insert_parents!`](@ref): add a new parent node to the filtered nodes
- [`insert_children!`](@ref): add a new child node to the filtered nodes
- [`insert_siblings!`](@ref): add a new sibling node to the filtered nodes
- [`insert_generations!`](@ref): add a new child node to the filtered nodes, but this new child is considered a whole new generation, meaning the previous children of the targeted nodes become the children of the new child node (*i.e.* a new generation).

!!! warning
    Note the plural form for the name of the functions. The singular form does the same thing but only on the node we provide as input. The plural forms do the job for every filtered node in the MTG.

The functions insert new nodes based either on a template NodeMTG or a function that computes it. The attributes of the nodes are empty by default, be can also be provided by the user either as is, or as a function that computes them.

The id of the inserted node is automatically computed using [`new_id`](@ref).

For example if we need to insert new Flower nodes as parents of each Leaf, we would do:

```@example usepkg
mtg_4 = deepcopy(mtg)
template = MutableNodeMTG("+", "Flower", 0, 2)
insert_parents!(mtg_4, template, symbol = "Leaf")
```

Similarly, we can add a new child to leaves using [`insert_children!`](@ref):

```@example usepkg
template = MutableNodeMTG("/", "Leaflet", 0, 3)
insert_children!(mtg_4, template, symbol = "Leaf")
```

Usually, the flower is positioned as a sibling of the leaf though. To do so, we can use [`insert_siblings!`](@ref):

```@example usepkg
mtg_5 = deepcopy(mtg)
template = MutableNodeMTG("+", "Flower", 0, 2)
insert_siblings!(mtg_5, template, symbol = "Leaf")
```

### Compute the template on the fly

The template for the `NodeMTG` can also be computed on the fly for more complex designs:

```@example usepkg
insert_children!(
    mtg_5,
    node -> if node.id == 3 MutableNodeMTG("/", "Spear", 0, 3) else MutableNodeMTG("/", "Leaflet", 0, 3) end,
    symbol = "Leaf"
)
```

### Compute attributes on the fly

The same is true for the attributes. We can provide them as is:

```@example usepkg
insert_siblings!(
    mtg_5,
    MutableNodeMTG("+", "Leaf", 0, 2),
    Dict{Symbol, Any}(:area => 0.1),
    symbol = "Leaf"
)
```

Or compute them based on the node on which we insert the new nodes. For example if we want the new node to take twice the values of the area of the node it is inserted on, we would do:

```@example usepkg
insert_siblings!(
    mtg_5,
    MutableNodeMTG("+", "Leaf", 0, 2),
    node -> node[:area] === nothing  ? nothing : Dict{Symbol, Any}(:area => node[:area] * 2),
    symbol = "Leaf"
)
```

!!! danger
    The function used to compute the attributes must return data using the same structure as the one used for the other nodes attributes. In our example it returns a `Dict{Symbol, Any}`, but it can be different depending on your MTG. To know which structure you should use, use this command:
    ```julia
    typeof(mtg.attributes)
    ```

Let's see the results for the area of our leaves:

```@example usepkg
DataFrame(mtg_5, :area)
```
